 Welcome, and thank you for your interest in contributing to `otp` — a high-performance, zero-dependency Golang implementation of HOTP, TOTP, and related standards.

We value clean code, security, and performance. Whether you're fixing bugs, implementing new RFCs, writing benchmarks, or improving documentation — you're in the right place!

## 📏 Code Guidelines

- Follow [Effective Go](https://golang.org/doc/effective_go.html).
- Favor **zero allocations** and **constant-time comparisons** for security.
- Ensure full test coverage.
- Include **benchmarks** if adding cryptographic primitives or performance-sensitive code.
- Use Go’s standard formatting:

```bash
make check
```

## 🧪 Adding a New RFC Implementation

If you're implementing a new OTP-related RFC (e.g., OCRA, HOTP extensions):

1. Create a dedicated test file with comprehensive coverage.
2. Update `README.md` if it affects public functionality.
3. Add benchmark functions using `testing.B`.
